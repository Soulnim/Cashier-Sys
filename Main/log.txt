DATE : 22 / 10 / 2022
TITLE : FIX LOGIN ISSUES
MODE : UPDATE
VERSION : 1.1
WRITER : LUQMAN

NOTE : 
- I HAD DETECTED THAT THE USER(STAFF) CAN LOGIN WITH OTHER STAFF'S PASSWORD AS THE SYSTEM ACCEPT ANY INPUT THAT MATCH THE CURRENT
  PASSWORD STORED IN THE SYSTEM. SO, THE STAFF DOESNT NEED TO ACTUALLY USE THEIR ACTUAL PASSWORD TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM.
  
CHANGE :
- UPDATE THE LOGIN FUNCTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CURRENT STAFF MUST INPUT THE PASSWORD THAT MATCH WITH THEIR ID. IF THEY TRY TO
  INPUT OTHER STAFF'S PASSWORD, THE SYSTEM WILL REJECT IT.
- [ SECURITY UPDATE ]
